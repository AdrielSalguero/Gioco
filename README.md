Benvenuto

This project arises from the need for a simple system to learn verbs, their conjugations and some of the most important connectors.

To do this we follow the following steps:

1 - Create the JSON files that act as a database for the knowledge of the Italian language.
2 - Create the code to load the game.
3 - Create each code for each game respectively.
4 - Manage the database.

In this simple program you can choose to:

- Play to learn the verbs, where I will give you the infinitive verb in Italian and you must complete the information regarding the word in Spanish with its conjugations in Italian (past and future) always with the person I.
- Play to learn connectors, I will give you five connectors and you will tell me in Spanish how they are translated.

Then the records are saved in a database to know who has practiced, if they have improved, and other metrics.

I hope you like it and have fun.

Greetings!
